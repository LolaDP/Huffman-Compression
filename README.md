# Huffman-Compression

This is a project for school where I have to create a Huffman algorithm to compress a text file.
The program must:
  - determine the alphabet and character frequencies
  - build a coding tree
  - code and compress the initial text
  - determine the compression ratio 
  - determine the average number of storage bits of a character in the encoded text
